CSV2QIF
=======

This script converts the CSV provided by CGD (CAIXA GERAL DE DEPOSITOS)
home banking system to a QIF format so the it can be imported to personal
finance systems.

It was tested only on wesabe (http://www.wesabe.com/).

USAGE
-----

./csv2qif.py statment.csv
or
python csv2qif.py statment.csv

the result will be save in a statment.qif file in the same directory as the csv file.
